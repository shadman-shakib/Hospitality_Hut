Nowadays, several small/medium size companies are operating throughout our country but, they are facing difficulties in terms of client management. The primary reason for this difficulty arises because, they have limited finance so, they are unable to afford a proper meeting place or room in which they will accommodate prosperous clients. Our proposal is that, many large/corporate companies have idle rooms which they does not use all the time. Therefore, if they are able to rent those rooms to these small companies then, it will be beneficial for both the parties. Larger companies will earn rent which will benefit them in monetary terms whereas, small companies will be able to accommodate their clients with ease. A win-win situation for both the parties.
